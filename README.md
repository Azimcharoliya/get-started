## Introductory Material

## Work to Precision

To write correct software, we need to specify the problem with precision.

[Try a visit-counter with different stakeholders](https://classroom.github.com/a/IBo-ej_p).

## The muse

It's good to have a couple of problems to decompose :)

1. [The Pong Game](pong-game.md) and its
[staged exercise](https://classroom.github.com/a/P509YaXc)
1. [Gather and Present health-data](gather-present-fit.md) and its 
[staged exercise](https://classroom.github.com/a/JtsFO5Lg)

## Modeling Modules

While diagrams are great to express our mental models, there is a catch.

Diagramming costs precious developer time and gets outdated.
But not having diagrams ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.

Let's try doing 'diagrams as code' using mermaid.
