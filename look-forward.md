# Looking Forward

We look forward to a journey of discovery along with you.

## A journey of discovery

Software Engineering is a field under constant discovery.
Writing code and making it work is difficult.
Keeping it working is more difficult.

Here we discover ways of writing software that works on a machine
and [digestible by humans](https://sudeeprp.github.io/default-coding/).

## Every learning is Self-learning

- There is no 'perfect' way. Look for consequences.
- You get it by experience. You gain experience by participating.

## It's not enough if it works

### Do

- Submit your best effort
- Precision is more valuable than correctness.
This way, your failures will help you succeed.
- Seek reviews
- Make _reasonable_ assumptions

### Don't

- Don't copy someone else's work. Don't do it.
- Don't do it all in the last moment.

### The comment is on the code

- Focus on the issue, not on the person
